Step 1 - Include all the header files which are used in the program and define a constant 'SIZE' with specific value.
Step 2 - Declare all the functions used in stack implementation.
Step 3 - Create a one dimensional array with fixed size (int stack[SIZE])
Step 4 - Define a integer variable 'top' and initialize with '-1'. (int top = -1)
Step 5 - In main method, display menu with list of operations and make suitable function calls to perform operation selected by the user on the stack.
